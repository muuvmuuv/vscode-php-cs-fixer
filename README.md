### How?

Install this extension through the marketplace and install PHP-CS-Fixer with composer locally. If you have PHP-CS-Fixer installed globally, please set the path to the executable in this extension's settings. This extension wont download PHP-CS-Fixer for you, because it is meant to be small and simple.

### Why?

Other extension are way to complex or include HTML formatting, which does not work well with PHP-CS-Fixer.

If you want HTML formatting, download Intelephense and run this extension together with _emeraldwalk.RunOnSave_.

### Development

Extension is bundled with esbuild, see package scripts for cli utilities. VS Code debugger has two options, one for a workspace project and one without.

Releases are made manually; increase the version and publish the package locally. Do not forget to commit all changes before making a release.
