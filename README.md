# PHP-CS-Fixer

> Install from here:

Run just the PHP-CS-Fixer with zero dependencies, just ~7 kb!

### How?

Install this extension through the marketplace and install PHP-CS-Fixer with composer
locally. If you have PHP-CS-Fixer installed globally, please set the path to the
executable in this extension's settings. I wont download PHP-CS-Fixer for you, because I
want it to keep small and simple.

### Why?

Other extension are way to complex or include HTML formatting, which does not work well
with PHP-CS-Fixer.

If you want HTML formatting, download Intelephense and run this extension together with
_emeraldwalk.RunOnSave_.
